    <h1>ERD about colors and shades</h1>
    <h2>About the table</h2>
    <p>The table lets the user choose a primary color and it will show two shades related to that primary color. The user has four primary colors to choose from.</p>
    <h2>Explanations of the relationships</h2>
    <p>My database uses two tables. A table called primarycolor and a table called shades. Both tables have IDs as their primary keys. They also have name columns and shades table has primarycolor ID as a foreign key.</p>
